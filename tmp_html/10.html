<div class="inner"><h1 style="text-align: center;">This year</h1><div class="time" style="text-align: center;">2021-12-31</div><p>Maybe I should write something today, but I don’t would to write anything recently. I use a grammar tool named “Grammarly” to help me correct my grammar error this moment. As for why I started to write this in English because I found Simplified Chinese is limited for some reason. And I am difficult to write something about emotion directly. I am trying a new way, although I could just use simple sentences.</p>
<p>Changing the job is the most correct and biggest thing this year I did. No need to talk about it more.</p>
<p>I make a new friend this mouth when playing script-killing. She was once an overseas study in Korea. She will be my first friend if she is exactly to be my friend. I recalled It’s full 3 years today from I come to Beijing. It’s full 3 years I don’t have any friends.</p>
<p>This is life, it keeps going on.</p>
